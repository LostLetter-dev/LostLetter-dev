ðŸ’Œ I am LostLetter-dev, but you can just call me Lost, or Linkletter as an alternative nickname - and I, am currently a student.

ðŸŒ± I am a...
- Programmer
  - Primarily using Python
  - Knowledgable on HTML and Javascript
  - Learning PHP...
  - Always looking to expand knowledge on languages.
- Modder
  - For Left 4 Dead 2 (Vscript / Squirrel)
  - Briefly in Garry's Mod and other LUA-using titles.
- "Hobbyist" Game Developer
  - Using Unity (CSharp)

ðŸ§¶ What this profile is...
- A show of what I can do; uploads of projects I've created in my own time as a hobby.
- An archive of (what I feel to be) notable mods that I have developed.
- Pet projects, basically.

ðŸª· Languages I know.
- Python (Primarily)
- Squirrel / VScript
- HTML & Javascript (Knowledgable, unpreferable.)
- CSharp (Learning; Unity pet projects)
- LUA (Vaguer knowledge - rusty.)
ðŸª´ I am always looking to learn new languages! I consider myself to be a fast learner, and can understand most programming languages fast once I get the hang of them.

ðŸŒ´ Fun facts!
- I love nature; I believe the best future of the world is for technology to reach a point where it can co-exist without many of the problems we face now.
- Currently, my favourite song is [Mystique part 2 by Timelord](https://youtu.be/ymHVOLxPv3E?feature=shared)
- Old technology fascinates me, I love learning about the past and how quickly the state of tech has advanced over the years.
- I am currently reading Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun.
